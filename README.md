This is something I've been trying to get working for a while, and am finally willing to take another stab at.

A while back I tried making a version of my Discord Bot, [Hallita](https://github.com/qanazoga/hallita) in Kotlin, and writing commands was extremely easy, and fun! But I had issues making a working Eval command (it eventually halfway worked, but required some weird hacky things and was generally a pain to use), so the project was scrapped and done in JavaScript instead.

I'm learning Clojure right now, and got a bot to work with Clojure and [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) a some time ago, however, that was just a test to see if I could Eval Clojure inside JDA. I want a full bot.

I want to keep the easy to write commands of Kotlin, but do the base of the bot in Clojure so I can still do nice and clean Eval commands. Thanks JVM!
