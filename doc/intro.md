# Introduction to Carlisle

## Planned Features
Ideally, Carlisle should be able to do everything Hallita could, and hopefully some of the things only [Soturi](https://gitlab.com/soturi/soturi-variants/soturi) could (and also some of Hallita's planned things I never finished).
I'm adding all of these things to the [project issues](https://gitlab.com/qanazoga/carlisle/issues) so I have an actual sense of progress as I work through them.

### Additional Things (Future Projects)
- Hallita had a planned feature that would allow per-guild setup thru Discord's OAuth, that's still a cool idea that I really wanna do.
- Bring back Soturi's [role signup](https://github.com/qanazoga/soturi/blob/master/cogs/role_signup_listener.py) feature, but with an easy way to set up that doesn't involve me manually adding entries to an unreadable JSON file.
- Bring back Soturi's [message filtering](https://github.com/qanazoga/soturi/blob/master/cogs/free_game_news_moderator.py) because it was great, and make it better by adding more filtering options. Again it should be made easy to set up via OAuth.


here's a quick link to my [references](./reference/README.md) so I can test pages.
